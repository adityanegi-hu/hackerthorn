 #Career Path Recommender 
This is a simple career path recommender tool that suggests potential career paths based on a user's input skill. The tool uses a predefined dictionary to map skills to corresponding career paths.

Features
Recommends career paths based on user input skill.
Handles cases where no specific career path is found for a given skill.
Provides a simple command-line interface for user interaction.
Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run the script using Python (e.g., python career_path_recommender.py).
Enter a skill when prompted (e.g., "programming", "design", etc.).
The tool will display a list of recommended career paths based on the input skill.
Code Structure
The code consists of the following components:

skills_to_career: A dictionary that maps skills to corresponding career paths.
recommend_career: A function that takes a skill as input and returns a list of recommended career paths.
main: The entry point of the script, which handles user input and displays the recommended career paths.
Example Use Cases
Enter a skill: programming
Recommended career paths: Software Engineer, Data Scientist, Web Developer
Enter a skill: leadership
Recommended career paths: Ability of an individual, group, or organization to influence or guide other individuals or teams.
Future Development
Expand the skills_to_career dictionary to include more skills and career paths.
Implement a more sophisticated algorithm for recommending career paths (e.g., based on user preferences, job market trends, etc.).
Develop a web-based interface for the tool.
